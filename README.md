# Gruvbox theme for cava
![preview](gruvbox-cava.png)

## How do I apply it?
1. choose your favourite theme and copy the contents
2. in you cava config file (should be ```~/.config/cava/config```) find the ```[color]``` section. delete ONLY from color (included) downwards and stop at ```[smoothing]``` (don't delete it)
3. paste what you copied from the gruvbox.cava file

## Help! the background looks weird
if the background is a solid color or some other issues try adding a ```; ``` to the start of ```background``` is. Doing so will con√¨mment out the background and might fix the issue (example kde window blur)
